Had made this program as a solution for a programming contest called MobMe CodeJam 
 
Dependancies (using Hashtable)
1. Dictionary used by spellchecker(dictionary.txt)
2. Word Database used by spellingsuggest(wordprobabilityDatabase)
3. Input Text File used by spellchecker(inputtext.txt)

Usage
The source files along with the dependancies have been sent. Compile the source code($javac spellchecker.java) and then run its class($java spellchecker).
